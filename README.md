# Curriculum Vitae

## Personal

My name is Sven Richter. I was born in 1980 in Plauen, a nice and beautiful town in the former eastern Germany.  
Currently I live in Leipzig, working for itCampus GmbH.  
My life is completed by a wonderful wife and a little on, which makes us a family of three.

## Interests:

* Functional Programming (especially Clojure)
* Programming (especially java, python, php)
* Interest in the avoidance of problems caused by state
* Webfrontend technologies like GWT and several javascript libraries
* Linux for a long time (since the mid-90ies)
* Database Knowledge
* Racing
* Classic Guitar
* Volleyball
* Poker

Of course there is always some kind of a shift. Coming from an OO world I get more and more attracted to the simplicity of functional programming. I am really interested to get more into these kind of topics.

## Background

I studied computer science from 2003 - 2010 in Leipzig at the http://www.htwk-leipzig.de/, writing my diploma thesis about a multiusershopsystem in Plone.

## Interesting projects of mine on Github
As I used github for a long time to collect ideas and stuff I may or may not work on there is a lot of noise here, so if someone wants to see some working code look at this:
* [friend-ui](https://github.com/sveri/friend-ui) This is a frontend to cemericks friend library. It uses enlive and twitters bootstrap as main technologies
