## Interesting projects of mine on Github

As I used github for a long time to collect ideas and stuff I may or may not work on, there is a lot of noise here,
so if someone wants to see some working code look at this:

* [OMTET](https://github.com/sveri/omtet) Online Multiplayer Tetris - WIP
Part of it is a tutorial for writing tetris in clojurescript with re-frame <http://tales.sveri.de/tags/tetris.html>
* [CLOSP](https://github.com/sveri/closp) A Leiningen template for a full featured web framework within the
clojure / clojurescript stack.
* [CLOSP-CRUD](https://github.com/sveri/closp-crud) A very basic CRUD generator for CLOSP.
* [SIWF](https://github.com/sveri/siwf) A user friendly webfrontend to the file system of a server.
* [friend-ui](https://github.com/sveri/friend-ui) This is a frontend to cemericks friend library.
It uses enlive and twitter bootstrap as main technologies.
* [PIX](https://github.com/sveri/webpics_grails) An online image viewer with a small set of functionality
(albums and user management). I mainly did this as I found existing applications not sufficient enough for my
needs or to feature rich.
* [read-sensors](https://github.com/sveri/read-sensors) An example project that reads files from file system and
stores their content in a HTML file.
* [ZFP](https://github.com/sveri/ZFP) A caching library we developed at Druck und Werte to speed up the web
application we developed there.

## Employments

* 2011 – now: Senior Software Engineer at <http://www.itcampus.eu/> in the Rules team where we work on the rules
feature for the Software AG webMethods Suite: <http://www.softwareag.com/de/products/wm/default.asp>.

in the printing business: <http://zmuek.net>.
* 2000 – 2010: While I was studying I have been a part time worker for almost 10 years.
 * Most of the time I was employed as a windows network administrator for a small windows business server
 environment at “planungsbüro helm und künzel gmbh”.
 * Doing several jobs as a webdesigner for small events like marriages.
 * Coding a bookmark manager in java and swing, using xml for data storage for fun.
 * Coding a cash programm for a little cafe in C++ with windows MFC.

## Teaching

As I am not only interested in constant improvement, but also in sharing knowledge, I started giving intern talks
and courses.
